    # JSON and Related Concepts

## JSON

**JSON** stands for **JavaScript Object Notation**.  
It is a standard way to store and transfer data between programs or between a server and a client (for example, between a website and a browser).

The main idea is to organize data clearly so that it is **human-readable** and **easy for programs to understand**.

### Structure

- Data is stored in **key-value pairs**.
- It resembles **JavaScript objects**.

## JSON Visualiser

A **JSON Visualiser** is a tool or program that converts raw JSON data into a **tree-like or visual structure**, allowing you to see keys and values clearly.  
This is especially useful when the JSON data is **large or complex**.

## body-parser

**body-parser** is a **middleware** in **Express.js** (Node.js framework) that reads data coming in the **HTTP request body** and converts it into a format that JavaScript can easily handle.

When you send a form or JSON to the server, the data arrives as **raw text**, and Express cannot understand it directly.  
This is where **body-parser** comes in.
